# 🌌 Astronomical Data Analysis and Visualization

This project explores the processing and analysis of astronomical images using Python. It focuses on visualizing FITS-format telescope data, applying noise reduction, and detecting stellar sources.

## 🧪 Features
- Load and view astronomical FITS images
- Apply Gaussian smoothing for noise reduction
- Detect stars using DAOStarFinder (from photutils)
- Plot and annotate detected sources

## 📁 Dataset
Sample FITS image used: Horsehead Nebula (via Astropy tutorial archive)

## 🛠️ Tools
- Astropy
- Photutils
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy

## 🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook locally or launch in Colab:

## 📌 Output
Detects and highlights stars in a telescope image using classic image processing + astronomy-specific methods.

## 📚 Credits
